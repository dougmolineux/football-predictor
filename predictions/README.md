## Quirks
For some reason, Brentford vs Crystal Palace has an Away Win Probablity of zero. It is finding the team correctly, in terms of translating to an index. If the home team is changed to Chelsea, then there is an unusually high Away probability, which is unusual because Crystal Palace's results have not necesserily been better than Chelseas.
